README:
archinstall_helper:
This is a step by step install guide for archlinux.
It should assist people who install archlinux the first time (e.g. used ubuntu before) and
people installing archlinux not as their daily routine.
Guide means that the user can open a help
for every of the installation steps
and look up what he has to do next.


Installing:
via makefile and DESTDIR=/usr or whatever

Using:
Enter ai-helper.sh. The rest should be self-explaining.
