now we need to prepare for fine-tuning. This means
creating an environment we can switch in
if you haven't mounted /mnt/boot yet (means: mount the partition designated for being the boot partition at this folder (see "mount")
do this now.
Before you enter via arch-chroot some infos:

- use "exit" to return from chroot
- chroot  (especially arch-chroot) will switch you in your new system. This means /mnt/xy is now /xy. Also your shell changes
- if you don't want your shell changing, install via pacstrap: zsh and grml-zsh-config, command: "pactstrap /mnt zsh grml-zsh-config"
    and you have also to use "zsh" as your favourite shell
- maybe this step-by-step guide isn't available, so prepare for switching back



Now it is the time to switch in your new system
Easy way:
enter "arch-chroot /mnt" or if you have a favourite shell "arch-chroot /mnt <favourite shell>"
hard way:
make important system directories in your fresh installed system available via:
mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys
analog for sys, proc, tmp, run, dev
