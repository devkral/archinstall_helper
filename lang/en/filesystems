in UN*X is everything a file. So are partitions or abstractions of it (e.g. lvm and cryptsetup)
These abstractions are found in /dev
so have a look into /dev (e.g. via "ls /dev/sd*" or for lvm/cryptsetup "ls /dev/mapper")
These new created partitions are blank (or contain garbage, which wasn't deleted) and must be formatted before you can use them\n
=> filesystem
    (WARNING: formating a partition destroys the former content)
filesystem can be created via the command:
mkfs.<filesystem format> <path to partition>
for an overview over installed filesystem formats (you can use) enter:
ls /usr/bin/mkfs.*

There is also a special filesystem named swapfs:
this filesystem is created via "mkswap <partition>"
it is used if the RAM is full and for hibernation support
for hibernation support it should be at least as big as your RAM, better: 3/2 of your RAM
