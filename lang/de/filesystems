in UN*X is everything a file. So are partitions or abstractions of it (e.g. lvm and cryptsetup)
These abstractions are found in /dev\n
so have a look into /dev (e.g. via \"ls /dev/sd*\" or for lvm/cryptsetup \"ls /dev/mapper\")\n
These new created partitions are blank (or contain garbage, which wasn't deleted) and must be formatted before you can use them\n
=> filesystem\n
    (WARNING: formating a partition destroys the former content)\n
filesystem can be created via the command:\n
mkfs.<filesystem format> <path to partition>\n
for an overview over installed filesystem formats (you can use) enter:\n
ls /usr/bin/mkfs.*\n
\n
There is also a special filesystem named swapfs:\n
this filesystem is created via \"mkswap <partition>\"\n
it is used if the RAM is full and for hibernation support \n
for hibernation support it should be at least as big as your RAM, better: 3/2 of your RAM
