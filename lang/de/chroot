now we need to prepare for fine-tuning. This means\n
creating an environment we can switch in\n
if you haven't mounted /mnt/boot yet (means: mount the partition designated for being the boot partition at this folder (see \"mount\")\n
do this now.\n
Before you enter via arch-chroot some infos:\n
\n
- use \"exit\" to return from chroot\n
- chroot  (especially arch-chroot) will switch you in your new system. This means /mnt/xy is now /xy. Also your shell changes\n
- if you don't want your shell changing, install via pacstrap: zsh and grml-zsh-config, command: \"pactstrap /mnt zsh grml-zsh-config\"\n
    and you have also to use \"zsh\" as your favourite shell\n
- maybe this step-by-step guide isn't available, so prepare for switching back\n
\n
\n
Now it is the time to switch in your new system\n
Easy way:\n
enter \"arch-chroot /mnt\" or if you have a favourite shell \"arch-chroot /mnt <favourite shell>\"\n
hard way:\n
make important system directories in your fresh installed system available via:\n
mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\n
analog for sys, proc, tmp, run, dev
